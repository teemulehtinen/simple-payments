Simple Payments Service
----------------------

This Django project is intended as a dummy payment service for educational use. We used it in our web programming course as part of a ecommerce site project. It is similar to real online payment services, but intended merely to give students an idea how such a service can be used.

Installation:
-------------
Should be as simple as:
- cloning the git repository ()
- running python manage.py syncdb
- running python manage.py runserver
Instructions on usage can then be found from http://localhost:8000/
